## What mini group 2 did:

First, we selected the Schaefer 200 ROI 7 Network atlas and a few of the demographic variables (BMI, age, sex). Then, we played around with the data a bit and inspected variables that are highly correlated with our p-factors in our training data. We landed on an ElasticNet regression so we could throw many features (some of which can be interdependent/correlated) into the model and it would select the most predictive features and weight them accordingly. To prepare the data, we removed the categorical demographics data and standardized our predictors before fitting the ENet regression. Using 5-fold cross-validation, we determined the best hyperparameter L1:L2 ratio for the model to be 0.1 and the alpha of 0.47. Of the 2001 features input as predictors into the model, 114 features were retained. The out-of-sample R² = 0.0629 and MSE = 0.853.



## Week-1 Project Template

This repository is a template for the NeuroHackademy 2025 week-1
projects. The goal of the project is to examine data from the
[Reproducible Brain Charts (RBC)](https://reprobrainchart.github.io/) database
and to use any of its data to predict the `p_factor` of a set of participants.
Project details can be found below.


## How to use this repository

This repository is a template repository. Please use the big green button in
the upper right corner of its [GitHub page](
https://github.com/NeuroHackademy2025/week1-project-template) that says "Use
this template" and select the "Create a new repository" option. We encourage
all group members to clone the repository (but only one group member should
upload the predicted data and make a pull request at the end; these steps are
documented in the analysis notebook).

Once you have forked the repository as a template, you should clone it locally
on the JupyterHub and open the `analysis.ipynb` notebook in the repository
root. This file contains an example workflow that loads in the surface area of
Brodmann Area 1 for each subject, trains a linear regression model to predict
the `p_factor` based on that surface area in the set of training participants,
then uses the trained model to predict the `p_factor` in for the test
participants based on their BA1 surface areas. Feel free to make your own
notebook or to modify this analysis notebook for your project.


## The RBC Database

The RBC database contains many independent datasets; in this project, we will
focus on just one of these datasets, the
[Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC)](
https://www.med.upenn.edu/bbl/philadelphianeurodevelopmentalcohort.html).
The data from this dataset have been collected into three GitHub repositories:
* [`ReproBrainChart/PNC_BIDS`](https://github.com/ReproBrainChart/PNC_BIDS)
* [`ReproBrainChart/PNC_FreeSurfer`](
  https://github.com/ReproBrainChart/PNC_FreeSurfer)
* [`ReproBrainChart/PNC_CPAC`](https://github.com/ReproBrainChart/PNC_CPAC)

Although you are welcome to use any data from the dataset to model and predict
the `p_factor`, we encourage you to focus on the data available in the
`PNC_FreeSurfer` repository, as it does not require sophisticated preprocessing
and is fairly easy to model in a short amount of time.

### What is `p_factor`?

The `p_factor` that you are tasked with modeling and predicting is a general
psychopathology factor that has been calculated for each subject. The details
of this calculation are not critical for this project, but more information can
be found in [this RBC publication](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.02.24.639850).

### Can't we just get the `p_factor` from the dataset?

We have provided two TSV files on the NeuroHackademy JupyterHub:
* `/home/jovyan/shared/RBC/train_data.tsv`
* `/home/jovyan/shared/RBC/test_data.tsv`

The first of these files, `train_data.tsv` contains a subset of the PNC
participants and various meta-data (including the `p_factor`) for each. The
`test_data.tsv` file contains the left-out test subjects, and all of the
`p_factor` cells in this data table have been set to `NaN`. Although it is
possible to find and extract the true `p_factor` values for these test
subjects, we encourage you not to do so, or at least not to do so until after
you have generated predictions. (We will provide the `p_factor` data to you
when the projects are completed).
